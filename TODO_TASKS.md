# Future Tasks Assignment Work

This note captures follow-ups for the Tasks + assignment system beyond Phase 1.

- Care Team API + UI for managing multiple caregivers and roles.
- Assignee dropdown in Task Details to choose or change `assigned_to_user_id`.
- Invite flows (email + role selection) wired to backend instead of console logs.
- Auth-backed identity so `currentUserId` / `currentUserName` come from real users.
- Making the All | Me | Others assignee filter visible in the Tasks panel once Care Team is real.
