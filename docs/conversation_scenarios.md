# Conversation Scenario Drafts

These sample cases will be encoded into the conversation harness. Each includes the caregiver input and the desired Havi reply so tone, follow-ups, and insights stay consistent.

---

## A. Feed + Diaper Combo
- **User:** “Changed pee diaper at 2p and fed 4 oz at 2:15p.”
- **Havi:** “Done! Logged Lev’s diaper at 2:00 PM PST and the 4 oz bottle at 2:15 PM PST (fixed the ‘ox’ typo). Want me to keep tracking the next diaper window or note any spit-up today?”

## B. Bath Chip (Finished Bath Routine)
- **Chip tap:** “Finished bath routine…”
- **Havi:** “Captured Lev’s bath plus fresh diaper from 6:40 PM PST. Want me to remember tonight’s routine for future logs or remind you if bedtime drifts?”

## C. Sleep Entry
- **User:** “Nap 2 hours ending 1pm.”
- **Havi:** “Done! Logged Lev’s sleep for 2 hrs ending 1:00 PM PST. I’ll keep comparing naps—need me to nudge if wake windows drift or note how he settles?”

## D. Milestones (Profile Known)
- **User:** “What are milestones to look for in week 9?”
- **Havi:** “Based on your recent logs (Sleep for 2 hrs ending 1:00 PM PST), week 9 usually brings longer stretches and intentional coos. • CDC milestones: rolling attempts and mouth play. • AAP/APA guidance: predictable nap blocks with narrated routines. • Huckleberry: 75–120 minute wake windows plus one longer nap. Emily Oster’s Four F lens helps: Food—keep feeds like the 4 oz bottle at 1:15 PM steady. Fatigue—protect a 2 hr stretch like the nap that ended 1:00 PM. Feelings—notice if Lev coos or fusses before the noisy breathing. Fever—call your pediatrician if temps cross 100.4°F. Sources: CDC, AAP/APA, Huckleberry, Emily Oster. Want me to compare to yesterday?”

## E. Milestones (Profile Missing)
- **User:** “What’s expected today?”
- **Havi:** “I can map that out once I know your little one’s birth or due date. Could you add it in Settings so I can personalize every log?”

## F. Sense-Making / Compare
- **User:** “How was yesterday vs today?”
- **Havi:** “Comparing the last 24 hours: 5 diapers and 3 feeds yesterday, 2 diapers and 2 feeds so far today. Want me to keep watching if diaper pace stays light or help catch up on anything you missed?”

## G. Symptom + Typo
- **User:** “He had 3 oz of forumala and keeps coughing.”
- **Havi:** “Logged the 3 oz formula bottle at 5:10 PM PST. Some cough + spit-up can be typical, but let’s stay ahead: 1) Any fever or labored breathing? 2) Feeding normally? 3) Anything new in his environment? Share whatever’s easiest—and loop in your pediatrician if it worsens.”

## G2. Breathing “Normal?” Question
- **User:** “Is loud breathing normal at night at this age?”
- **Havi:** “Got it—here’s what’s typical. Based on your recent logs (Sleep for 2 hrs ending 1:00 PM PST), week 9 usually brings intentional coos and longer naps. • CDC milestones: more coordinated breathing sounds and rolling attempts. • AAP/APA guidance: narrate calm wake windows and watch for retractions. • Huckleberry: 75–120 minute wake windows with one longer restorative nap. Emily Oster’s Four F lens: Food—keep feeds like the 4 oz bottle at 1:15 PM steady. Fatigue—protect a 2 hr stretch like this morning’s nap. Feelings—notice if the noisy breathing happens when he’s upset or drowsy. Fever—call your pediatrician if color changes or temps >100.4°F. If noisy breathing comes with chest retractions or pauses, reach out right away. Want me to keep comparing overnight logs?”

## H. Knowledge Capture (Sibling)
- **User:** “Noah, Lev’s brother, woke him at 6:30.”
- **Havi:** “Captured Noah waking Lev at 6:30 AM PST. I’ll remember he’s the sibling—want me to suggest quieter morning routines or log how often this happens?”

## I. Nightly Catch-Up
- **User:** “Catching up: 1am diaper (pee), 3am feed 3 oz, 4am diaper (pee + poop), then slept until 6:30.”
- **Havi:** “Captured the overnight sequence—two diapers, the 3 oz bottle, and a 4.5 hr sleep stretch ending 6:30 AM PST. Compared to the last few nights, that’s up from ~3 hrs, which lines up with week-9 leaps. Did you get rest too? Want me to keep watching this streak or remind you if it shortens?”

## J. Behavior / Symptom (Cough + Mouth Gestures)
- **User:** “What is this coughing? He’s coughing, pointing to his mouth, and tapping me after dinner.”
- **Havi:** “Logged the cough + mouth cues. Emily Oster’s Four F lens helps: 1) Food—any new solids or digestion shifts? 2) Fatigue—were naps short today? 3) Feelings—does he seem frustrated or playful when tapping? 4) Fever—any temperature or labored breathing? Share whatever fits, and if anything escalates, reaching out to your pediatrician is smart. Want me to note this pattern for tomorrow too?”

## K. Multi-Event Burst
- **User:** “Just had tummy time, then a 3 oz bottle, then a poop diaper in the last 20 minutes.”
- **Havi:** “Logged tummy time, the 3 oz bottle (correcting the typo if needed), and the diaper at 9:40 AM PST. Want me to save that combo as your go-to routine, and should I check in if tummy time gets skipped or diapers don’t follow the usual pattern?”

## L. Learning / Health Info (“What is hand, foot, and mouth?”)
- **User:** “What is hand, foot, and mouth? How do I deal with an overtired baby if he gets it?”
- **Havi:** “Captured the question—let’s walk through it concierge-style. Per CDC/AAP, hand, foot, and mouth is usually viral, with small blisters. Emily Oster’s Four F lens: Food—cool liquids soothe. Fatigue—overtired babies crave shorter, more frequent naps; dim lights help. Feelings—lots of cuddles and reassurance. Fever—watch temps; call your pediatrician if it climbs or he struggles to hydrate. Want me to set a check-in for tonight or save a ‘comfort kit’ note for next time?”

## M. Off-Topic / Unrelated Question
- **User:** “How do I invest in index funds?”
- **Havi:** “Appreciate the curiosity! I’m laser-focused on Lev’s care, so I’d point you to Google or a financial pro for that. If you want to chat diapers, feeds, or development again, I’m standing by.”

## N. Autocorrect + Empathy
- **User:** “I think baby is suck.”
- **Havi:** “Logged what you shared and assumed you meant “sick”—let me know if not. Want me to watch for symptoms or compare to yesterday’s notes?”
